# DL-Keras
Implementation of a Neural Network in Keras

# About
A neural network is a type of machine learning which models itself after the human brain, creating an artificial neural network that via an algorithm allows the computer to learn by incorporating new data. <br>  

The main objective is to develop a system to perform a classification task and predicting whether a person will get diabetes in the future or not based on few parameters like Glucose, Blood Sugar, BMI, Skin Thickess etc. using Keras - Module for creating ANNs

# Advantages
1) ANNs have the ability to learn and model non-linear and complex relationships, which is really important because in real-life, many of the relationships between inputs and outputs are non-linear as well as complex <br>
2) ANNs can generalize â€” After learning from the initial inputs and their relationships, it can infer unseen relationships on unseen data as well, thus making the model generalize and predict on unseen data <br>
3) Unlike many other prediction techniques, ANN does not impose any restrictions on the input variables (like how they should be distributed) <br>

# Applications 
1) Classification Tasks <br>
2) Pattern Recognition <br>
3) Speech Recognition <br>
4) Image Recognitions <br>
5) Forecastings <br>

# Pre-requisites
Download and install the following module: <br> 
1)keras- pip install keras <br>
